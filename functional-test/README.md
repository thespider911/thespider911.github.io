# Functional Programming Exercises

This project contains implementations of three programming exercises using functional programming concepts in JavaScript:

1. Coin Counter
2. Roman Numeral Converter
3. Prime Sifting

## Author
Nathan Mbicho

## Setup

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

## Running Tests

To run the tests for all exercises, use the following command:
`npm test`

This will run all the test suites and display the results in your terminal.

## Exercise Details

### 1. Coin Counter

Located in `src/coinCounter.js` and tested in `test/coinCounter.test.js`.

This exercise includes two implementations:
- A recursive coin counter function
- A closure-based coin counter function

### 2. Roman Numeral Converter

Located in `src/romanNumerals.js` and tested in `test/romanNumerals.test.js`.

This exercise includes:
- A recursive function to convert numbers to Roman numerals

### 3. Prime Sifting

Located in `src/primeSifting.js` and tested in `test/primeSifting.test.js`.

This exercise implements the Sieve algorithm recursively to find prime numbers up to a given limit.

## Code Structure

The code for each exercise is structured to use functional programming concepts such as recursion, closures, and currying. The implementations avoid mutating state and focus on using pure functions.
